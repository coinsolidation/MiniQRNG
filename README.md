What is Mini QRNG?

Mini QRNG is Software and Hardware that includes three technological solutions to create
QRNGs (Quantum Random Number Generators). Classified as follows:

a.- QRNG API. - Quantum random number generator obtained from external servers.

b.- MiniQRNG / Software. - Random quantum number generator obtained using the physical
properties (quantum) of the mobile phone camera.

c.- MiniQRNG / Hardware. - Quantum number generator obtained using hardware based on
the quantum physics properties of a laser. Later on we will tell you how to build it at home
at a low cost.

Today's cryptography is based on random number sequences. The pseudo-random number
generators currently in use appear to provide random bit sequences, but in reality these bit
sequences have certain patterns, so there is a risk of being hacked or otherwise manipulated
to make the information travel over public and pirated networks.

The integration of sources of physical entropy in random number generators is the most
common method to overcome this security threat. However, classical physics is causal, so
the unpredictability of a bit sequence generated with classical physics cannot be proven.

Quantum physics, on the other hand, is essentially random. The numbers generated by a
quantum random number generator (QRNG) cannot be predicted: QRNG is demonstrably
unpredictable. So, if a quantum random number generator is used in a security system, even
a fast supercomputer with fast arithmetic operation cannot predict the random bit
sequences used by this security system.

Quantum physics uses methods based on a fundamental concept called entropy
